# Check Reviews

Find PRs with unaddressed review feedback from Codex and human reviewers.

## Usage

```bash
/check-reviews
/check-reviews --project <path>
/check-reviews --repo <owner/name>
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project`, `-p` | Path to target project (overrides workspace config) |
| `--repo`, `-r` | GitHub repository as owner/name (overrides auto-detection) |

## What it does

1. Lists all open PRs with reviews
2. Shows review decision status for each PR
3. Checks for Codex review comments with priority levels (P1/P2/P3)
4. Displays priority breakdown for each PR
5. Provides next steps guidance

## Benefits

- Ensures review feedback is addressed before starting new work
- Detects both Codex and human review comments
- Priority breakdown helps focus on critical issues first
- Prevents context loss from switching issues

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - authenticated and configured
- `jq` - JSON parsing

## Priority Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| P1 | Critical | Must fix before merge |
| P2 | Important | Should address |
| P3 | Minor | Nice to have |

## Next Steps

After running `/check-reviews`:

1. If reviews are found, use `/address-review <pr-number>`
2. If no reviews, proceed with `/claim-issue <number>` for new work
