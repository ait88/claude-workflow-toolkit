# /sync-skills

Updates all skills in the current workspace from the toolkit's template files.

## Usage

```bash
/sync-skills [--dry-run]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be updated without making changes |

## What It Does

1. Locates the toolkit source (via `TOOLKIT_SOURCE` config or default paths)
2. Runs `install-skill.sh --all --update` to update all skills
3. Reports which skills were updated

## When to Use

- After pulling toolkit updates that include template changes
- When validation shows outdated skills
- After fixing a bug in a skill template

## Configuration

The skill looks for the toolkit source in this order:

1. `TOOLKIT_SOURCE` variable in `workspace-config`
2. `~/claude-workflow-toolkit` directory
3. Parent of the skills directory (for embedded installations)

## Example

```bash
$ /sync-skills
