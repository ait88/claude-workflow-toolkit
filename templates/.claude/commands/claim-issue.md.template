# Claim Issue

Atomically claim an issue and set up your working branch.

## Usage

```bash
/claim-issue <issue-number>
/claim-issue --project <path> <issue-number>
/claim-issue --repo <owner/name> <issue-number>
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project`, `-p` | Path to target project (overrides workspace config) |
| `--repo`, `-r` | GitHub repository as owner/name (overrides auto-detection) |

## What it does

1. Fetches issue details from GitHub
2. Validates issue is open and available
3. Removes `agent-ready` label
4. Adds `in-progress` label
5. Creates and checks out feature branch: `<issue>-<title-slug>`

## Example

```bash
/claim-issue 35
```

## Benefits

- Atomic operation ensures consistent state
- Auto-generates branch name from issue title
- Handles existing branches gracefully
- **Reduces 4-5 API calls to 1**

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - authenticated and configured
- `git` - for branch operations
- `jq` - JSON parsing

## Branch Naming

Branches are automatically named:
- Pattern: `<issue-number>-<title-slug>`
- Max length: 60 characters
- Special characters replaced with hyphens

Example: Issue #35 "Add user authentication" becomes branch `35-add-user-authentication`

## Next Steps

After claiming an issue:

1. Implement the feature
2. Run tests: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
3. Validate: `/check-workflow`
4. Submit: `/submit-pr`
