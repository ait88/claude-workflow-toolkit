# Address Review

Checkout a PR branch and display all review feedback for addressing.

## Usage

```bash
/address-review <pr-number>
/address-review --project <path> <pr-number>
/address-review --repo <owner/name> <pr-number>
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project`, `-p` | Path to target project (overrides workspace config) |
| `--repo`, `-r` | GitHub repository as owner/name (overrides auto-detection) |

## What it does

1. Fetches PR details (title, branch, state, author)
2. Checks out the PR branch automatically
3. Displays Codex review suggestions with file locations
4. Shows human review comments organized by file
5. Lists general PR review comments
6. Provides step-by-step fix workflow

## Benefits

- Single command to switch context and see all feedback
- File locations help navigate to issues quickly
- Clear separation of Codex vs human feedback
- Includes test and commit commands for convenience

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - authenticated and configured
- `git` - for branch operations
- `jq` - JSON parsing

## Example

```bash
/address-review 42
```

Output shows:
- PR title and metadata
- Branch checkout confirmation
- All Codex suggestions with file:line references
- Human review comments by file
- General PR-level comments

## Next Steps

After addressing feedback:

1. Run tests: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
2. Commit: `git commit -m 'fix: address review feedback'`
3. Push: `git push`
4. Notify: `gh pr comment <pr> --body 'Addressed feedback'`
