# Claude Code Workflow Skills

Optimized skill commands for Claude Code agents working on this repository.

## Available Skills

### `/claim-issue <issue-number>`

Atomically claims an issue and creates a feature branch.

**Usage:**
```bash
/claim-issue 35
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates issue exists and is open
2. Updates labels (removes `agent-ready`, adds `in-progress`)
3. Creates branch: `<issue>-<title-slug>`
4. Checks out the branch

---

### `/check-workflow`

Validates current workflow state using a single GraphQL query.

**Usage:**
```bash
/check-workflow
```

**What it does:**
1. Extracts issue number from current branch
2. Fetches issue + PR data in one API call
3. Validates labels match workflow stage
4. Provides fix commands for issues

---

### `/submit-pr [title] [body]`

Creates PR and updates labels atomically.

**Usage:**
```bash
/submit-pr
/submit-pr "Add feature X" "Detailed description here"
```

**What it does:**
1. Pushes current branch
2. Creates PR (auto-fills from commits if no title)
3. Updates labels (removes `in-progress`, adds `needs-review`)
