# Claude Code Instructions

This workspace uses **claude-workflow-toolkit** for structured development.

## Required Workflow

**NEVER push directly to main.** Always use the PR-based workflow:

```
/worker --status  →  /worker --once  →  implement  →  /worker --once
```

## Getting Started

1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```
   /worker --status
   ```
   This shows: skill updates needed, PRs needing attention, available issues, and suggested next steps.

2. **Start a work cycle:**
   ```
   /worker --once
   ```
   Claims the next issue and creates a feature branch.

3. **Continue after implementing:**
   ```
   /worker --once
   ```
   Runs quality gates and submits PR.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/worker --status` | **Entry point** - Show workflow status and next steps |
| `/worker --once` | Run one work cycle (claim → implement → submit) |
| `/worker` | Continuous autonomous loop |
| `/worker --help` | Show all worker options |
| `/check-reviews` | Detailed view of PRs needing attention |
| `/claim-issue <n>` | Claim specific issue (alternative to worker) |
| `/submit-pr` | Manual PR submission (alternative to worker) |
| `/sync-skills` | Update skills from toolkit templates |

## Workflow Rules

1. **Start with `/worker --status`** - See what needs attention
2. **Address reviews first** - Worker blocks if PRs need attention
3. **One issue at a time** - Claim, implement, submit, then move on
4. **Use feature branches** - Branch naming: `<issue-number>-<slug>`
5. **Quality gates must pass** - Tests and lint before PR submission
