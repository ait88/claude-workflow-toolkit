# Claude Code Instructions

This workspace uses **claude-workflow-toolkit** for structured development.

## Required Workflow

**NEVER push directly to main.** Always use the PR-based workflow:

```
/worker --status  →  /worker --once  →  implement  →  /worker --once
```

## Getting Started

1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```
   /worker --status
   ```
   This shows: skill updates needed, PRs needing attention, available issues, and suggested next steps.

2. **Start a work cycle:**
   ```
   /worker --once
   ```
   Claims the next issue and creates a feature branch.

3. **Continue after implementing:**
   ```
   /worker --once
   ```
   Runs quality gates and submits PR.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/worker --status` | **Entry point** - Show workflow status and next steps |
| `/worker --once` | Run one work cycle (claim → implement → submit) |
| `/worker` | Continuous autonomous loop |
| `/worker --help` | Show all worker options |
| `/check-reviews` | Detailed view of PRs needing attention |
| `/claim-issue <n>` | Claim specific issue (alternative to worker) |
| `/submit-pr` | Manual PR submission (alternative to worker) |
| `/sync-skills` | Update skills from toolkit templates |

## Workflow Rules

1. **Start with `/worker --status`** - See what needs attention
2. **Address reviews first** - Worker blocks if PRs need attention
3. **One issue at a time** - Claim, implement, submit, then move on
4. **Use feature branches** - Branch naming: `<issue-number>-<slug>`
5. **Quality gates must pass** - Tests and lint before PR submission

## The Golden Rules
# 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

# 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

# 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

# 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
