# Claude & Codex Workflow Skills

> **Example output** - This shows what generated skills look like after applying the toolkit.

Optimized skill commands for Claude Code and Codex agents working on this repository. Skills live in `.claude/skills` and should be mirrored to `.codex/skills` (symlink recommended) so both agents run the same commands.

## Available Skills

### `/claim-issue <issue-number>`

Atomically claims an issue and creates a feature branch.

**Usage:**
```bash
/claim-issue 35
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates issue exists and is open
2. Updates labels (removes `agent-ready`, adds `in-progress`)
3. Creates branch: `<issue>-<title-slug>`
4. Checks out the branch

---

### `/check-workflow`

Validates current workflow state using a single GraphQL query.

**Usage:**
```bash
/check-workflow
```

---

### `/submit-pr [title] [body]`

Creates PR and updates labels atomically.

**Usage:**
```bash
/submit-pr
/submit-pr "Add feature X" "Detailed description here"
```
